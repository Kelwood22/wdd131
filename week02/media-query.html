            <h2>D&C 50:24-25</h2>
            <p>24 That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that
            light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.
            
            25 And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth, that you may chase darkness from among
            you;</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and
            my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have
            faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>
